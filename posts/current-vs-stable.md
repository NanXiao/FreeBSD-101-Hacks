CURRENT VS STABLE
----
`FreeBSD` has two development branches: `FreeBSD-CURRENT` and `FreeBSD-STABLE`.  

`FreeBSD-CURRENT` is the active development branch of `FreeBSD`, and all new development work, such as adding new feature, will occur in `FreeBSD-CURRENT` branch firstly.  

`FreeBSD-STABLE` is span off from `FreeBSD-CURRENT`, and for production version. It mainly accepts bug and security fixes.  

You should notice, branches are not points but constant streams of development. And the `FreeBSD RELEASE` version is a point, and it is just a snapshot of `FreeBSD-STABLE` branch at some time.
